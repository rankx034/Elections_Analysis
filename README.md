# Election Analysis for Denver, Jefferson, and Arapahoe Counties
## Introduction
This audit was conducted in order to gather information about voter turnout in the given tri-county area, as well as to calculate the winner in the election as a whole. This information is useful not only to create a snapshot of voter turnout, but because this code can subsequently be automated and compiled for consecutive election years as a way to gauge voter participation over time in a wide area. 

## Audit Results
- The three counties involved in the audit are as follows: Jefferson (Population 582,910), Denver (Population 705,576), and Arapahoe (Population 656,590). Across all three counties, the total number of votes cast was 369,711. 

## Audit Summary and Recommendations for Future

- it would be worth it to include total number of registered or eligible voters to capture actual voter turnout
- consolidate multiple years' election results in a csv file with a row for year which can be iterated over to capture data from a particular election year
